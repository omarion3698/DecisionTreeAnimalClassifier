# DecisionTreeAnimalClassifier

## Author
Omar A. Hussein

## Description
This project involves developing a decision tree classifier to categorize animals into mammals and non-mammals. I have used 2 datasets that I have included in this repository.
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation of classification performance.

## Set Up Instructions

Follow the instructions to get the project:-

### Prerequisites
  * Python 3.8
  * Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Pydotplus

### Installation

1. Clone or download these repositories and open the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.

2. Install Dependencies

  * pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn Pydotplus

3. Download the dataset

4. Open the respective notebooks to try out the built models above in a Google colab.

## Technologies Used

Here are the technologies used for the project:

  * Python: Programming language for implementing the decision tree classifier and data processing.
  * Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
  * Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building and evaluating the decision tree model.
  * NumPy: Library for numerical operations and data handling.
  * Pydotplus: Tool for converting DOT format to graph objects for visualizing the decision tree.

## Features

  * Utilizes a decision tree algorithm with entropy criterion.
  * Includes feature engineering and data preparation.
  * Provides predictions on test data and compares them with actual labels.
  * Visualizes the decision tree for better interpretability.
